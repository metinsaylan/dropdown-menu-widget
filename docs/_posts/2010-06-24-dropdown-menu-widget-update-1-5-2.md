title: Dropdown Menu Widget Update 1.5.2
tags: ['dropdown menu widget']
---

I updated the dropdown menu widget plugin today. It was a huge update so I think I will get a lot of comments about the new version. This update was necessary to make it work with wordpress 3.0. While doing that I played a little with default styles &amp; plugin itself.

Here is a list of things that are new with this update:
<ul>
	<li>**Wordpress 3.0 compatible**,</li>
	<li>**Support for Wordpress 3.0 navigation menus**, (Widget automatically adds your navigation menus to menu select dropdown)</li>
	<li>Themes got better &amp; simpler now,</li>
	<li>Fixed background problems with themes (for example "Shiny black" theme now supports wider links),</li>
	<li>**Added option to rename home link**. You can easily change your home link text from Settings -&gt; Dropdown menu options panel,</li>
	<li>**Added custom [CSS](/tag/css/) insert option**. Now you can easily add your customization without changing any files.</li>
</ul>
While updating the plugin I wanted it to be a clean version. So I removed some unused elements from the plugin. Here is a list of things I removed from the plugin,
<ul>
	<li>Removed **Exclude Pages** plugin. This wasn't working because of meta box changes in wordpress. You can easily get this plugin from wordpress plugins.</li>
	<li>Removed **inline style** option from the plugin. You can use **custom css** instead of inline styling.</li>
	<li>Removed Custom Walker support for now. I may add it later on if needed.</li>
	<li>Removed Blue Tabs theme because it was custom walker dependant.</li>
</ul>
I hope you won't get hurt by those changes. And after all those changes what's next? Here is a list of things I want to complete with the next version:
<ul>
	<li>Easy Menu Theme Creator,</li>
	<li>Custom class support,</li>
	<li>A New Tabbed Menu Theme.</li>
</ul>
Now, its your turn. Just update the plugin an see if you'll like it.
