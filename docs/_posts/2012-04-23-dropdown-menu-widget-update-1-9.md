**<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/wordpress/dropdown-menu-widget/" title="Dropdown Menu Widget">Dropdown Menu Widget</a>** version 1.9 is released today. With version 1.9, I added ability to change arrow colors now. You can change your **parent item arrow colors** in the options panel. ***  I also added 2 new themes to the plugin: **Pills** and **Rounded corners**. I'm sure their colors won't fit for most sites out there, but you can customize those stylesheets and save them to your theme folder named `dropdown.css`. This way you will have a custom dropdown theme, which you can then select from the options page. It will be added to the dropdown menu theme select box.

I also added a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/wordpress/dropdown-menu-widget/help/" title="Dropdown Menu Widget Help">Dropdown Menu Widget Help</a> page now, you can <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/wordpress/dropdown-menu-widget/help/" title="Dropdown Menu Widget Help">check it out here</a>.
