I really want to improve [Dropdown Menu Widget](http://metinsaylan.com/projects/wordpress/dropdown-menu-widget/), but when you see thousands of people using it, It is really hard to change a code.

In this update, however, I made a lot of mods, hoping that, those changes won't make current users angry. Here are the major changes in this version:

* Fixed rename homepage problem
* Removed table wrapper around the menu, added a div instead
* Removed all unnecessary files (well nearly all)
* Removed tabs and simplified settings page for responsiveness
* Updated documentation links and descriptions
* Removed crappy widget footer links

I think that's all for now.

If you see any problems or encounter any bugs, feel free to DM me on twitter.

Also don't forget to [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/metinsaylan) for Dropdown Menu Widget news.

Cheers.
