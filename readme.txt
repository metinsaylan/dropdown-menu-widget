== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't have sidebar on my header, how can I add one? =

Adding a sidebar in WordPress is a quite easy task. You can [read instructions here](http://metinsaylan.com/wordpress/2010/04/30/how-to-widgetize-your-theme-in-3-simple-steps/). If you don't want to add a sidebar consider using [PHP template tag](http://metinsaylan.com/wordpress/2011/07/31/dropdown-menu-widget-template-tag-usage-explained/) instead.

= I added this widget to my sidebar but it looks all weird! =

This widget is intended for *wide header widget areas*, not regular sidebars. You can [add a sidebar](https://metinsaylan.com/727/how-to-widgetize-your-theme-in-3-simple-steps/) to your theme or you can [get a theme](http://metinsaylan.com/lists/themes-support-dropdown/) that supports dropdown menu widget. If you don't want to add a sidebar, you can use [PHP template tag](https://metinsaylan.com/4598/dropdown-menu-widget-template-tag-usage-explained/) instead.

= Can I create my own theme? =

Since this plugin works on CSS, if you are capable of writing CSS, you can customize the theme as you like it. If you want full customization select `None` as your theme.

= I don't know CSS, how can I customize it? =

Plugin comes with various themes already installed. If you don't like existing themes put `dropdown.css` in your theme root and it will be selectable on themes list ;)
