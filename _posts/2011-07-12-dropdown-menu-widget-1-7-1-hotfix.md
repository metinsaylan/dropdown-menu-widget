title: Dropdown Menu Widget 1.7.1 hotfix
tags: ['dropdown menu widget']
---
With the 1.7 release of **<a title="Dropdown Menu Widget" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/wordpress/dropdown-menu-widget/">dropdown menu widget</a>**, I changed the whole options page interface. Apparently I forgot to edit the **template tag** support for the new interface, that's why sites using the template tag`<!--?php shailan_dropdown_menu(); ?-->` were displaying vertical menus instead of horizontal. I **fixed** this issue with 1.7.1 version. Please update your plugin now to the latest version. Sorry for the inconvenience. Cheers..
