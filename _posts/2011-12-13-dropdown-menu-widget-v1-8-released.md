title: Dropdown Menu Widget v1.8 released
tags: ['dropdown menu widget']

Yesterday **Wordpress 3.3** was released. When I upgraded my site, I realized that there was a javascript conflict with the **Dropdown Menu** plugin. So I fixed this issue with this new version. While fixing that, I also added **parent item indicators** code to the options page. You can disable or enable arrows next to parent items on the plugin options page. Here is a screenshot of the plugin options page:

<a href="{{ site.imgbase }}/2011/12/parent-item-indicators.png"><img src="{{ site.imgbase }}/2011/12/parent-item-indicators.png" alt="" title="parent-item-indicators" width="560" height="369" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3052" /></a>
