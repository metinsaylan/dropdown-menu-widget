After a long time (3 years exactly) I decided to update <a href="http://metinsaylan.com/wordpress/plugins/dropdown-menu/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Dropdown Menu Widget</a> because it was giving some serious errors. Errors that was caused by WordPress core changes. Here is what I have changed with the latest update:

 * **Fixed walker class errors**, which is used to generate menus in WordPress. Now after installing the plugin it must not give any errors.
 * **Removed font-size attributes from themes**. In the 2.0 update I am willing to change theming experience to a whole new method. I will try not to effect old users but it is rather old now. So this needs to be done.
 * **Changed url's in plugin widget and help pages**. Since I have closed shailan.com and decided to move on with my personal site, I am changing all my plugin links to my own site.


I don't know when I can find time to work on 2.0 version. But It will definitely make a difference. My primary goals for version 2.0 will be:

 * Responsive menu design
 * Easier appearance management
 * Internationalization
 * Integration with WordPress Menus feature
