Today I released alpha1 version for dropdown menu widget. With this new version now you can select your own colors through the dropdown menu settings page. Go update your widget and enjoy this new feature now ..

Here is a snapshot of the custom colors panel:
<a href="{{ site.imgbase }}/2010/08/dropdown-menu-custom-colors.jpg"><img src="{{ site.imgbase }}/2010/08/dropdown-menu-custom-colors.jpg" alt="" title="dropdown-menu-custom-colors" width="300" height="153" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1175" /></a>

Note: Since this is an alpha release I don't recommend updating the plugin for the regular users.
